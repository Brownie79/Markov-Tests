Help: I'm trying to install Facebook's SDK to a project on Android studio following the guide on FB's developer site but I keep running into

 "Gradle DSL method not found: compile()".

All the code i have:

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.0.0'

        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here;       they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:[4,5)'
    }
}  //close buildscript

allprojects {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}

This is my first time working on Android studio (first time building an app). I have search through StackOverflow for solutions but none I found solved the problem.
