Hey folks, StartupBus was one of the most intense and inspiring hackathon-style events I've ever done. It totally changed the course of my life and career and I would strongly encourage people to apply. Imagine getting on a bus with 30 other hackers, designers, and entrepreneurs and spending the next week driving cross-country while building a technical and business startup prototype that you get to demo to a panel of judges in Boulder at Startup Week.
