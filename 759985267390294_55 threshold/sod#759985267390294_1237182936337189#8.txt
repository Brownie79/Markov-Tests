We got accepted into Google Accelerator (ta-daaah!) and will be building Acorn Academy - online learning in tech and entrepreneurship for teens . 

We are looking for instructors to create online courses in tech (programming languages, UX, gaming, app development etc) and entrepreneurship (digital marketing, pitching, leadership, business models, financial planning, legal etc) for teenagers.

If you are connected to anyone who has created online courses, or would like to start, please send them here: http://teach.acornacademy.io/ or if you are not ready to teach, but would like to take part in hackathons for teens or mentor (check out #acornhack and #acornhackgirls on Twitter!) do sign up here: https://acornaspirations.typeform.com/to/WJm6kO 

And lastly, if you know of any teens or teen networks anywhere in the world, please send them here: get.acornacademy.io Thank you so much in advance!
