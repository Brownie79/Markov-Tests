TEXT:What would be a good next step after Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course?  I would like to understand convoluted neural networks better.  I was following the deep learning tutorial on Tensorflow's website, but I don't completely understand what it's talking about though I'm not completely oblivious any more thanks to Andrew Ng's course.
